# COMP782_RRT_Implementation

COMP 782 Assignment 2 Code

This code implements the clear and link functions used for many motion planning algorithms. It continues to implement the Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm in which random points are generated to build a tree until it forms a path from a start point to an end point. The tree is made up of points within a work space with the weights computed as the distance between the points. Dijktra's algorithm finds the shortest path within the tree from the start point to the end point.
